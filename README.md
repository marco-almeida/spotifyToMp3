# spotifyToMp3
Python script that downloads spotify songs/playlists/albums into mp3 files. 


Warning: Since I don't have an official certificate to sign my file with, Windows may recognize it as virus, or a possibility of virus. You can click the more options button and execute regardless. 

It will then open a command line in which you should click enter and then further instructions will appear.
