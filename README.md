# spotifyToMp3
Python script that downloads spotify songs/playlists/albums into mp3 files. Windows only. Not 100% accurate

.exe file: Since I don't have an official certificate to sign my file with, Windows may recognize it as virus, or a possibility of virus. You can click the more options button and execute regardless. 

It will then open a command line in which you should click enter and then further instructions will appear.


.py file: As stated in the comments, you'll have to make a text file with your own spotify api credentials and change the path in the code in order to run it. Beware that the first text line should be the id and the second should be the secret key.
